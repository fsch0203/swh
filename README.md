# Smart Web History

Smart Web History is a small extension to get better and faster access to the browser history. It shows you all the domains you have visited, sorted per domain. In a second table you see all the urls (or deep links) for the selected domain. So if you for example select the Youtube-domain, it shows you all the videos you have seen. Smart Web History is  available as Chrome and Edge extension.

The standard history function of chromium browsers saves all visits with 10 information fields per visit over a maximum period of 3 months. This app only saves the last visit with 4 information fields: the domain, title, url and date of the last visit. The resulting smaller database makes it possible to save urls over a much longer period of time (no limit). All the information is saved locally in the browser and can be exchanged with local data files (json-format).

It results in a lot of redundant information that is hardly ever used, while the time period is relatively short.
